#  Credit Risk & Loan Approval Case Study

Automatically approve or reject loans based on customer credit score and provide tailored investment suggestions to reduce loan burden.

---
## Overview
This case study automates *loan approval* based on customer credit score:  
- *Approve* if credit score ≥ threshold  
- *Reject* otherwise  

If approved, the system provides personalized *investment suggestions* to help borrowers minimize loan burden and pay off faster.

---

## Problem Statement
Financial institutions need a quick and reliable method to:
1. Assess a customer’s creditworthiness  
2. Automatically approve or reject loan applications  
3. Offer investment guidance post-approval to improve repayment outcomes

---

## Objectives
-  Automate loan approvals using credit score  
-  Integrate simple, effective investment suggestions for approved loans  
-  Measure impact: default rate, ROI, borrower savings

---

## Approach & Methodology
1. *Data Collection*: Synthetic or anonymized borrower data (credit score, income, loan amount, etc.)  
2. *Threshold Rule*: Define minimum credit score for approval  
3. *Investment Suggestion Logic*: Example strategies—prepayment plans, short-term bonds, mutual funds  
4. *Evaluation Metrics*: Approval rate, simulated savings, risk-adjusted return

| - | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Approve with good score       | credit\_score=750             | status=Approved, suggestions provided          |
| 2 | Reject with low score         | credit\_score=450             | status=Rejected, no suggestions                |
| 3 | Edge case – exactly threshold | credit\_score=600 (threshold) | status=Approved                                |
| 4 | Suggestions accuracy          | loan\_amount=10000, term=12   | List of investment options with ROI estimates  |
| 5 | Simulated savings verify      | suggested investments         | Compare and validate savings/reduction results |
